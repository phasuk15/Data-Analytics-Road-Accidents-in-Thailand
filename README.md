# Thailand Road Accidents & Road Types Analysis (2022)

This repository contains a data analytics project analysing road traffic accidents in Bangkok, Thailand for the year 2022, with a specific focus on how accident frequency and severity vary across different road types.

The project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and risk factors in Thailand’s road network using real-world accident data, supporting data-driven insights into road safety.

## 📊 Project Overview

Thailand consistently ranks among countries with the highest road traffic fatality rates worldwide. This project explores:

- How road accidents are distributed across different road types
- Whether certain road types are associated with higher accident frequency or severity
- Key trends in Thailand’s road accident data during 2022

## 🗂 Datasets

The analysis uses:
- **Thailand Road Accident Data (2022)** — accident counts, casualties, and related attributes  
- **Thailand Road Type Data** — classification of roads (e.g. highways, rural roads, urban roads)
